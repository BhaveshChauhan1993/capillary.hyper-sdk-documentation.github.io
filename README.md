# Hydra SDK

Installing the Hydra SDK will provide you with basic analytics functionality with which you can engage your users. With this SDK you can track users in two ways.
1. [Track User Events](track-user-events.md#track-user-events) These are the specific traits of a user such as an email, username, mobile, gender and so on. User Attributes helps target users based on these attributes across devices or installs or to personalize the messages.
2. [Track Behavioral Events](track-behavioral-events.md#track-behavioral-events) This will help you record various actions performed by the users. You can track an event using this api with the event name and its characteristics (attributes/properties).
